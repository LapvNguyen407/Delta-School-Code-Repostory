DESCRIPTION - 
4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing

Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.

TITLE JavaScript Objects

CODE 
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

DESCRIPTION 
Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods
In real life, a car is an object.
A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:
All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.
This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:

title: JavaScript Let

code: 
let x = "John Doe";

Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.
You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable.

title - JavaScript Arrays
code
const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];
des = Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.
It is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword.
Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

title - JavaScript if, else, and else if
code -
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}

des - Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
des A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

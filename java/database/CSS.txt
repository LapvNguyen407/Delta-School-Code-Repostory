TITLE - 
CSS - Introduction CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

CODE - 
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}

DESCRIPTION - 
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

TITLE - 
CSS - Selectors CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

CODE -
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

DESCRIPTION - 
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color:

TITLE - 
CSS Margins
Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
Margin - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:
auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element
Tip: Negative values are allowed.

CODE -
p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}

DESCRIPTION - 
Set different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:

TITLE - CSS Text
CODE - 
body {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

div {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

DESCRIPTION - CSS has a lot of properties for formatting text.
The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:
a color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

TITLE - CSS Fonts
CODE - 
.p1 {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}

.p2 {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

.p3 {
  font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;
}
DESCRIPTION - 
In CSS there are five generic font families:
Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families. 
The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma.
Specify some different fonts for three paragraphs:

}

ol.c {
  list-style-type: upper-roman;

ol.d {
  list-style-type: lower-alpha;
}
DESCRIPTION - In HTML, there are two main types of lists:
unordered lists (<ul>) - the list items are marked with bullets
ordered lists (<ol>) - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
The CSS list properties allow you to:

Set different list item markers for ordered lists
Set different list item markers for unordered lists
